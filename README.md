## Abstract
With the rapid development of remote sensing (RS) technology and the convenient accessibility of massive remote sensing image datasets, change detection (CD) has become one of the most attractive tasks in remote sensing research. The purpose of change detection is to recognize changes between bi-temporal images of the same area captured at different times, assigning the label of change or un-change to each pixel of the area. The detection of change in remote sensing has significant practical applications in land cover surveys, \cite{DBLP:journals/ijgi/ItuenH21, DBLP:journals/tgrs/LvWCBLS22}, urbanization monitoring \cite{DBLP:journals/tgrs/MarinBB15, DBLP:journals/lgrs/LiuPZZY21} and natural disaster evaluation \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1910-06444}.
